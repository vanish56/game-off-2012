# Shifting Sands

## Background

Shifting Sands is an adaptation of a board game my wife designed last year. It has been to several conventions and been playtested by top designers and the core of the game is solid, but something has not quite felt right. I have decided to build the digital version of this game in hopes of trying several different changes to the mechanisms behind the game.

## Concept

In Shifting Sands, players compete to be the first alien on planet Earth to land their mothership. Each player has sent a representative agent of their species underground with a special wind control device. With this wind control device, the player must clear a flat area in the desert by pushing and pulling the dunes. Players must be cunning in their decision on which dunes to manipulate, in order to not reveal their agent's location. Once the player has cleared all the dunes surrounding their agent, they reveal their agent and call down the mothership to win!

## Gameplay

The game is divided into two phases, with most of the game taking place in the "Action Selection" phase.

* Beamin Down - Placing of each player's agent (simultaneous)
* Action Selection - In turn order, do two actions: Push, Pull, Place

In the Action Selection phase each player gets two actions and those two actions must be different:

Actions are as follows:
* Push a tile (dune) to an adjacent, empty space; or
* Pull a tile from the board and place it on a communal tile space (marked A-T); or 
* Place one of the removed tiles from the communal tile area back on the playing board in any empty space, adjacent to at least one other tile.

Play will continue in player order (first player gets two actions, then second player gets two actions, etc.). 

Remembering where your agent is hiding is an important part of the game! No peeking under tiles on the board (or looking into the game's memory in this digital version!).

### Additional Rules for Push

A tile can only be moved into an adjacent, empty space. A movement of the previous player cannot be immediately undone.

### Additional Rules for Place

Tiles may be taken from any letter space in the sea of removed tile spaces. All tiles placed back on the playing board must be adjacent to at least one other tile. A Pull of the previous player cannot be immediately placed back in the space the tile was pulled from.

## Game End

The game ends when a player has isolated their agent. There must be six empty spaces around the alien for the mother ship to land, being on an edge or corner does not count. When a player believes they have done this they **Land the Mothership!** and they flip over what they believe to be their agent tile. If it is their agent, they win!

If the tile flipped over is not their agent tile, they are out and play continues without them.

If all but one player is out, the last player must show that his alien is still on the island to claim victory!
